![MYSO Airdrop](img/airdrop.jpg "MYSO Airdrop")

**MYSO** is launching the MYSO Token (\$MYT) and distributing tokens to value-aligned communities, including the **Curve DAO**. 

> To check your eligibility and claim \$MYT, go to: https://app.myso.finance/airdrop


## Why MYSO
[MYSO's mission](https://www.myso.finance/) is to be the go-to place for advanced yield enhancement strategies, with a particular focus on bespoke **[covered calls](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/covered-call-options-strategy)** and **structured products**. The MYSO v2 protocol has facilitated over \$1.2M in covered calls, including with the [Telos treasury](https://medium.com/mysofinance/first-native-tlos-covered-call-successfully-completed-cbd69f5e6f3d) as well as the [Evmos treasury](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-evmos-treasury-debut-covered-call-strategy-512f6f9b2226) (see [past transactions](#other-users-of-myso)).

MYSO Finance originated out of the [ETHOnline Hackathon in 2021](https://ethglobal.medium.com/ethonline-2021-8bd473b78b99), where it was awarded as one of the finalists. MYSO closed a [\$2.4M seed round](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-closes-2-4m-seed-round-2f4f8114144e) in 2022 with several crypto-native investors such as HashKey, Wintermute, Nexo, and GSR.

## MYSO Token
The MYSO Token (\$MYT) allows users to participate in the growth of the MYSO ecosystem. Post airdrop, \$MYT will be distributed exclusively through the MYSO [IOO](https://twitter.com/MysoFinance/status/1785023287459713145), a novel token launch mechanism pioneered by MYSO. \$MYT supply is fixed with fully diluted supply of 100,000,000 tokens and with the following distribution:
* **Ecosystem Growth**: 39.90% or ~39,900,000 \$MYT
* **Treasury**: 30.00 % or ~30,000,000 \$MYT
* **Core Contributors**: 19.17% or ~19,170,000 \$MYT
* **Investors**: 10.93% or ~10,930,000 \$MYT

## Extra MYT Rewards for Curve
Curve token holders can earn extra \$MYT by doing a covered call through MYSO. How to:
* **Step 1**: Create your own non-custodial lender vault on [MYSO](https://app.myso.finance/vaults).
* **Step 2**: Deposit at least \$50,000 worth of CRV into your vault.
* **Step 3**: Get an indicative quote [here](https://myso-covered-call.streamlit.app). Simply select `Curve DAO (CRV)` as token and decide which tenor, and strike combination you'd like to trade.
* **Step 4**: Join [MYSO Discord](https://t.co/hS2cTTd4LE) or [MYSO Telegram](https://t.me/MysoFinance), and share the indicative quote you'd like to trade.
* **Step 5**: Get matched with an institutional trading firm and receive 24% APY in \$MYT.

Note: the \$MYT yield is **on top** of the organic upfront stablecoin premium you earn from the CRV covered call.
